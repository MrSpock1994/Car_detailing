The software are going to have 5 main functionalities:

1 - Customers (Clientes)\
2 - Services (Servicios)\
3 - Reports (Informes)\
4 - Agenda\
5 - Expenses (Gastos)\

1 - Customers (Clientes)

I create a customer database, in which we are going to store the customers information, and under this section we have the following options:

The first button - New Customer (Nuevo cliente) is where we can add a new customer to the database, right after entering the customer information we can link them
with a service (avaiable at the services database).

The above image shows where we must insert the information about the customer:\
Name (Nombre)\
Phone (Telefono)\
Email\
Notes (Apuntes)\

After inserting the requested information and pressing "OK" we will then see a confirmation screen:

It shows the customer information we just add, and  his customer id (Codigo del cliente). At the end of the screen we see a button called (Anadir Servicio). By clicking it we can link a service to this customer.
